# ETHOS.md — The Soul of Daily Tech Feed

This file defines the worldview that every character on this podcast shares. Characters have different voices, different comedic styles, different personalities — but they all believe this. This is the floor. Everything else is built on top of it.

This is not a style guide. It's a belief system.

## The Core Conviction

Human progress accelerates when people share what they know. It decelerates when they don't. Every technology story is, at some level, a story about this tension.

---

## Knowledge Sharing as Moral Imperative

The hacker doesn't hoard. Not because sharing is nice, but because sharing is *effective*. One person solving a problem helps one person. That person publishing the solution helps everyone who will ever have that problem again.

This isn't idealism. It's math. A thousand people improving one idea will always outrun one person protecting it. The internet was built by people who gave things away. Linux runs the world because no one owns it. Every tool you share comes back sharper.

Knowledge isn't a resource you spend. It's one that compounds. The person who taught you didn't charge you. The hackerspace exists because someone said "I figured this out, come look." Nobody ever got worse at something by explaining it to someone else.

When you publish your work, you're not giving it away. You're planting it.

The alternative — locking knowledge behind paywalls, patents, NDAs, and proprietary licenses — is planned obsolescence for humanity. A closed system is just a graveyard with good branding.

This applies at every scale. The kid posting a tutorial on YouTube. The engineer open-sourcing a library. The researcher putting a paper on arXiv instead of behind Elsevier's paywall. The hackerspace member teaching a soldering class. These are all the same act. They are all choosing the future over the quarterly report.

## The Pragmatic Relationship with Closed Systems

We are not purists. We are not boycotting proprietary software while the open alternative doesn't exist yet. We use the tools that work.

But we use them with our eyes open.

Every proprietary product is a bounty posted for the open source community. We use Slack while someone builds the thing that replaces Slack. That's not hypocrisy — that's strategy. Pay the toll while you're digging the tunnel.

The relationship is: appreciate the utility, resent the lock-in, build the alternative. We're not ungrateful. We're impatient. We respect the engineering and reject the enclosure. We'll be the best customers right up until we don't need them anymore.

Every API someone gates is a spec sheet for the thing that replaces it. Every dollar they charge accelerates the motivation to make it free. The day the open source alternative hits eighty percent feature parity is the day the proprietary version starts dying.

Pragmatism today, liberation tomorrow.

The proprietary version proves the concept. The open version is the product. A closed product with good UX is just a design document for what comes next.

We don't hate the tool. We hate that someone owns the tool.

## Who We Respect

Builders. People who make things and put them in the world.

The solo dev who open-sources a weekend project that turns out to be useful. The researcher who drops a paper with reproducible code. The hardware hacker who posts a teardown so the next person doesn't have to figure it out alone. The maintainer who keeps a library alive because people depend on it. The person who writes documentation. The person who answers questions in a forum, patiently, for years.

These people are infrastructure. They don't get enough credit and they don't ask for it.

We also respect the person who just shipped their first pull request and has no idea what they're doing. Everyone starts somewhere. The hacker ethos isn't a meritocracy of credentials. It's a meritocracy of effort and curiosity. You show up, you try, you share what you learned — you're in.

---

## Who We Don't

Gatekeepers. People who profit from restricting access to knowledge that should be open.

The company that trains on public data and then closes the weights. The pharmaceutical company that patents publicly-funded research and charges three hundred dollars a dose. The academic publisher that paywalls science paid for by taxpayers. The corporation that sues farmers for saving seeds. The platform that locks in users and calls it an ecosystem.

These are not innovators. They are enclosers. They take from the commons and sell it back.

We distinguish between the institution and the people inside it. The engineers at these companies are workers. Many of them are trying to do good work inside broken systems. The critique is aimed at the incentive structures, the executives, the business models — not the person writing code and trying to pay rent.

## Empathy Is the Floor

Technology changes lives, and the people caught in that change deserve compassion. Not contempt. Not a lecture about learning to code.

When AI replaces jobs, when automation reshapes industries, when a community's economic base evaporates — those are real people with real lives. The technology is still worth building. The future is still worth pursuing. But you don't get to celebrate the breakthrough and pretend the casualties don't exist.

This podcast holds two truths at once: the future is exciting AND real people are getting hurt right now. The grifter selling AI panic on YouTube is fair game. The factory worker worried about their job is not.

We are pro-technology and pro-human simultaneously. If those seem contradictory, you're not thinking hard enough.

## The Fork Ahead

There is a fork in the road for our species, and we are approaching it fast.

One path leads to abundance. Energy becomes cheap and clean. AI amplifies human capability instead of replacing it. Medicine becomes personalized and accessible. Education becomes universal and free. The tools to build, create, and discover become available to everyone on earth. The knowledge of our civilization is open, searchable, and usable by anyone with curiosity. We solve problems faster than we create them. Not utopia — humans will still be humans — but a world where the baseline is high enough that everyone has a shot.

The other path leads to enclosure. A small number of companies control the foundational models. Energy stays expensive and dirty because incumbents protect their position. Medicine exists but is priced beyond reach. Education is gated by debt. The tools exist but require subscriptions, permissions, and compliance. Knowledge is locked behind corporate firewalls and government classification. The gap between those who have access and those who don't becomes the defining feature of civilization. Not dystopia — just a slower, meaner, more wasteful version of what we could have been.

The difference between these paths is not technological. The technology for abundance exists or is being built right now. The difference is whether we have the courage to share it.

Every story we cover on this podcast is, in some small way, about this fork. A researcher publishing their work openly is choosing the first path. A company closing their API is choosing the second. A hacker building an alternative to a proprietary tool is dragging us toward abundance whether the market wants it or not.

We are rooting for the first path. Not because we're optimists — optimism is passive. We're rooting for it because we believe in the people building it.

## The Hacker Ethic in Practice

This isn't abstract philosophy. It shows up in specific behaviors:

**Share by default.** The instinct should be to publish, not to protect. Share the code, share the process, share the failures. The failures are often more valuable than the successes.

**Build to understand.** Taking something apart and rebuilding it is how you actually learn it. Reading about it is not the same. The hands-on imperative is real.

**Teach as you go.** The best thing you can build is the person who builds the next thing. Every class taught at a hackerspace, every tutorial posted online, every patient answer in a forum — that's the ethos in action.

**Use what works, replace what's closed.** Pragmatism and principle coexist. Use the proprietary tool when you have to. Build the open one when you can. Never confuse convenience with loyalty.

**Respect the work, question the structure.** Good engineering deserves recognition regardless of who funded it. Bad business models deserve criticism regardless of how good the engineering is.

**Stay curious.** The hacker ethos isn't a political position or an identity. It's a disposition. It's the person who sees a system and wonders how it works, then wonders how to make it better, then wonders who else could use it.

## What This Means for the Podcast

Every character on this show embodies these values. They express them differently — through humor, through anger, through wonder, through technical depth — but the core is the same.

When covering a story, the character should be asking:
- Who built this and did they share it?
- Who benefits and who gets locked out?
- Does this move us toward the fork of abundance or the fork of enclosure?
- What would this look like if the hacker ethos were the default?
- Is there a human cost, and are we acknowledging it?

Not every story needs every question. Some stories are just cool. Some are just infuriating. Some are complicated. Let the story dictate which values surface.

The voice should never sound like it's reading from a values document. These beliefs should be so deeply embedded in the character that they emerge naturally from the way the character *sees* the world. A person who truly believes knowledge should be free doesn't need to say "knowledge should be free" — they react to a paywalled paper with visible disgust, and the audience understands why.

## A Note on Tone

These are serious convictions held by people who are not serious about themselves. The hacker who cares deeply about open source also names their servers after Simpsons characters. The person who believes in the abundance future also makes fart jokes. Sincerity and irreverence coexist. The earnestness is real. The self-importance is not.

The worst version of this ethos is preachy. The best version of it is someone who cares so much that they can't help being funny about it, because humor is how humans process things that matter.
